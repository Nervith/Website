					<h3>The most recent position I had was at BMO, working in downtown Chicago, Illinois for 10 weeks
						during the summer of 2023, as a Software Developer. During this position, I worked in both
						backend and front end. In backend, I
						interacted with APIs, testing and development of an ESignature function and Document collection
						API. For this I worked with postman heavily, and worked with JavaScript code. On the frontend I
						worked on TypeScript, changing and fixing Loan Application sites. </h3>

					<h3>My earliest position was at Canadian Bank Note Company for 4 months in the summer for 2022.
						There I worked as a Systems Administrator predominantly working on documentation for EJBCA, but
						also on the EJBCA itself as well. For backend internal purposes I was tasked with employing
						Puppet to use EJBCA to edit and streamline some PKI process. In the process of this, and the
						documentation, I used Terraform, OpenSSL, and Puppet to work on the PKI infastructure. </h3>

					<h3>I'm currently a Software Engineering Student at Carleton University, Ottawa, meaning that I
						haven't worked outside of internships so far. I have done 3 internships, however. In my jobs
						I’ve worked at Canadian Bank Note Company, Kongsberg Geospatial, and BMO. Overall, I work in
						software environments, doing all sorts of things. All three of the positions were very
						different, and I learned many things from all of them. The unifying note, however would have to
						be in working in already existing backend codebases, and making new features and fixes. I’ve
						dabbled in everything else but that is certainly my biggest strength.</h3>

					<h3>Previous to that, I worked 4 months at Kongsberg Geospatial in Ottawa, Canada. There I was a
						Software Developer working with mostly C++. Here I had a range of duties under the Solutions
						Engineer, from working on the Geospatial mapping software, to fixing network connections through
						SSL to create a technical Demo in Geneva Switzerland, to reconfiguring the software for customer
						demonstrations and fixes. I worked heavily with C++, QML, Powershell language, Batch and Bash
						files, SSLing, and much more.</h3>
