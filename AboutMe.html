										<h3>I am primarily interested in backend, cloud, DevOps, platform, and reliability oriented roles where system behavior, correctness, and maintainability matter more than surface level features. I am actively developing projects focused on backend systems and infrastructure tooling, with an emphasis on production style design, automation, and clear documentation. My goal is to build deeper systems expertise while contributing reliably in real world environments.</h3>

										<h3>I am a software engineering graduate focused on backend, cloud, and infrastructure adjacent roles in enterprise environments, with strengths in debugging production systems, automating workflows, and improving reliability. I have hands on experience with Java backend services, Python automation, SQL, Azure, and operational support in regulated organizations, and I am comfortable diagnosing failures and making targeted fixes.I also bring strong communication skills through leadership in debate and Toastmasters, with experience explaining technical issues clearly and coordinating across technical and non technical stakeholders. I am most interested in backend, cloud, DevOps, platform, or reliability focused roles where correctness and maintainability matter.</h3>

										<h3>This site is a central place for documenting my technical work, projects, and ongoing learning. It is intended to show how I think about systems, tradeoffs, and implementation, rather than just listing technologies, and to provide concrete examples of my approach to building and maintaining software.</h3>

									<h3>I bring strong communication skills through leadership in competitive debate and Toastmasters, with experience explaining technical concepts clearly, writing structured explanations, and working across technical and non technical stakeholders. I value clarity, accountability, and practical problem solving, and I tend to do best in roles that require both technical ownership and clear communication.</h3>
